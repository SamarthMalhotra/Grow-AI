Good Evening Everyone,

Today, I am going to explain my second project, an AI chatbot that I developed using the Gemini API. I have named this project Grow AI, and I believe it is unique.

Let me explain the technologies I used in this project:

Frontend Technology: React JS😊
Backend Technology: Node.js👍and Express.js👍

Database: MongoDB😊

Version Control System: Git👍 and GitHub👍

Deployment: Render😊

**Key Features of Grow AI:**

**1->Responsive layout** – works perfectly on all devices.

**2->User-friendly**-interface for easy interaction.

**3->Built using Gemini 2.5**, the latest version of the API.

**4->Interactive and engaging layout.**

I would like to kindly request everyone to review the code, provide valuable suggestions, and contribute if possible.
